# SQL-Project
SQL project conducted in the Udacity Data Analysis Advanced Nanodegree. In this project I assisted a music store with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information using SQL queries. I used a visualization tool to better understand the queries output.

Files needed to run the project:
- Queries.txt
- chinook.db
